# SmallServers
Just Small Servers for fun  and profit. Base for simulators
The idea for now is to create simple monothread servers for comparison in
Go, C++ and python, probably this will change though

# Compilation cpp
once boost is installed in the system compilation line:
 * g++ server.cpp -lboost_system
